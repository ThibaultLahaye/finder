    Calculate the cost of a permutation in the Traveling Salesman Problem.

    Checks for np.inf values during each iteration of the loop. 
    If an infinite distance is encountered, the cost is set to np.inf, 
    and the loop is broken out of. This avoids unnecessary computation if 
    a city in the permutation is not connected to the next city.

    The keyword argument 'parallel=True' was specified but no transformation 
    for parallel execution was possible.

    Parameters:
    - distance_matrix (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between cities.
    - permutation (numpy.ndarray): A 1D array representing a permutation of cities.

    Returns:
    - float: The cost of the given permutation.

    Calculates the cyclic edge distance between two permutations.

    Cyclic edge distance treats permutations as sets of undirected edges, considering the last element
    connected to the first. For example, the permutation [1, 5, 2, 4, 0, 3] is equivalent to the set of
    edges {(1,5), (5,2), (2,4), (4,0), (0,3), (3,1)}.

    The distance between two permutations is the count of edges that differ. It accounts for undirected
    edges, meaning (i, j) is considered the same as (j, i).

    :param permutation_1: First permutation.
    :param permutation_2: Second permutation.

    :return: Cyclic edge distance between the two permutations.

    Example:
    >>> permutation_1 = np.array([1, 5, 2, 4, 0, 3])
    >>> permutation_2 = np.array([5, 1, 4, 0, 3, 2])
    >>> cyclic_edge_distance(permutation_1, permutation_2)

    Runtime: O(n), where n is the length of the permutations.

    Cyclic edge distance was first described in:
